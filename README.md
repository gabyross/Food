## About Food app

The application is going to prompt a user with a search bar at the top of the screen and the user is going to be able to search for some kind of restaurant.

Once the user ask for a restaurant, we'll get some results from  a search API that we're going to be making use of, and then the app is going to display those in a series of lists on the screen.

Each of these are going to be different categories of restaurants that we find.

We're going to first present some cheap options, inexpensive restaurants, then a little bit pricier and then finally some really high tier, really expensive restaurants down at the bottom.

Each of these different sections are going to scroll horizontally. So we're going to allow the user to scroll left or right to see a list of cheap restaurants and then moderate and then expensive.

Once a user taps on a given restaurant, we are going to take them to a detailed page where we show them a couple of images from that restaurant on the screen in a kind of list that they can scroll through very easily.

When a user is on this detail screen, they are able to hit that back button and go back to the original search results over here as well.
